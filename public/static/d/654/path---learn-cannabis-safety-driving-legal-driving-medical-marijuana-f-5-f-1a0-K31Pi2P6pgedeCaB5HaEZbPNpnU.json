The same laws that apply to driving under the influence of alcohol, also apply to driving under the influence of marijuana.","long_answer":"With some medications, it is difficult to determine if someone is under the influence at the time of a urine or blood test, because the substance can be detected long after the effects have worn off. This is the case with marijuana, because its metabolites linger in the body for an extended period of time. Because of this, someone could fail a blood or urine test, even though they are not under the influence at the time. State Sen. Tick Segerblom, Nevada’s leading medical marijuana advocate who sponsored the 2013 legislation that established the dispensary system, proposes a better alternative would be to issue DUIs based on a subjective test using an officer’s observations instead of blood and urine tests.","date":"2019-05-16T04:00:00+0000","author":null,"category":{"uid":"cannabis-safety"},"cover_image":{"alt":"","localFile":{"id":"2bec38ee-02b3-5d30-9a95-cc4a7983f982","childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.5,"src":"/static/240653d2dbdc321a393beef875c5bfdb/86722/5c0393ec49f8264ced72d8911c16e9801ab50f66_screen-shot-2019-05-16-at-7.25.40-pm.png","srcSet":"/static/240653d2dbdc321a393beef875c5bfdb/9ff6f/5c0393ec49f8264ced72d8911c16e9801ab50f66_screen-shot-2019-05-16-at-7.25.40-pm.png 300w,\n/static/240653d2dbdc321a393beef875c5bfdb/32839/5c0393ec49f8264ced72d8911c16e9801ab50f66_screen-shot-2019-05-16-at-7.25.40-pm.png 600w,\n/static/240653d2dbdc321a393beef875c5bfdb/86722/5c0393ec49f8264ced72d8911c16e9801ab50f66_screen-shot-2019-05-16-at-7.25.40-pm.png 1200w,\n/static/240653d2dbdc321a393beef875c5bfdb/2fe98/5c0393ec49f8264ced72d8911c16e9801ab50f66_screen-shot-2019-05-16-at-7.25.40-pm.png 1800w","sizes":"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"}}}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"Id":"Prismic__Question__XN2_2REAACkAm-uo"}}

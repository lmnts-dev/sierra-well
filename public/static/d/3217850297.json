Because of this, someone could fail a blood or urine test, even though they are not under the influence at the time. State Sen. Tick Segerblom, Nevada’s leading medical marijuana advocate who sponsored the 2013 legislation that established the dispensary system, proposes a better alternative would be to issue DUIs based on a subjective test using an officer’s observations instead of blood and urine tests.","date":"2019-05-16T04:00:00+0000","author":null,"category":{"uid":"cannabis-safety"},"cover_image":{"alt":"","localFile":{"id":"2bec38ee-02b3-5d30-9a95-cc4a7983f982"}}}}},{"node":{"id":"Prismic__Question__XN3AahEAACgAm-45","uid":"will-medical-marijuana-be-covered-by-insurance","tags":["insurance","coverage","medical"],"data":{"title":{"text":"Will medical marijuana be covered by insurance?"},"short_answer":"The Federal Drug Administration has to approve a drug for use before insurance companies can cover it, and that hasn’t happened with medical marijuana yet.","long_answer":null,"date":"2019-05-16T04:00:00+0000","author":{"id":"XN3gnhEAACYAnHwP","document":[{"id":"Prismic__Person__XN3gnhEAACYAnHwP","data":{"name":{"html":"<h1>Wesley McQuillen</h1>","text":"Wesley McQuillen"}}}]},"category":{"uid":"medical"},"cover_image":{"alt":"","localFile":{"id":"6876c848-baa5-5437-a308-1635504dc49d"}}}}},{"node":{"id":"Prismic__Question__XN3ADhEAACYAm-yV","uid":"can-patients-grow-their-own-marijuana","tags":["grow","cultivate","patients","medical","dispensary","register"],"data":{"title":{"text":"Can patients still grow their own marijuana?"},"short_answer":"Yes, patients can grow up to 12 plants if they register the address of where they’re growing and list all the occupants with the state.","long_answer":"When dispensaries open, patients who live within 25 miles of one won’t be allowed to grow their own marijuana without a special exemption from the state.
